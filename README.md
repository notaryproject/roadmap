# Roadmap
## Process and Tools
The Notary V2 team uses the [Roadmap GitHub Project Board](https://github.com/orgs/notaryproject/projects/2) to track short term (1-3 months) and medium term (3-6 months) efforts and long term (6-12 months). Once a broad objective (from the "Research" column) is further scoped into a GitHub issue that has a clear objective, background and motive, it is moved into the "Backlog" column. From there, the team plans releases via [GitHub Milestones](https://github.com/notaryproject/notaryproject/milestones).

## Current and Future Objectives
At this time, the Notary community is working on NotaryV2 specification  and two separate sub projects, TUF and Notation. This roadmap is focused  on the NotaryV2 specification  and Notation

### Current (Short term) Focus
- Putting Alpha Release(s) out of Notation for early feedback and testing. Multiple "alpha" milestones are tracking to it.
- Iterate on the Notary V2 specification for the first GA Release. 
- Collaborate with other open source projects for co-related/dependent features needed for end to end use case of OCI artifacts signing

### Future (Mid to Long term) Focus
- Release the first [GA version of the Notary V2 specification and Notation](https://github.com/iamsamirzon/ForTestPurpose/projects/1). This milestone is marked as "RC-1"
- Iterate on supporting additional signature formats in the specification
- Support Revocation in the Notation Client
