# Notary v2 Alpha 3 Release

## Overview
Notary v2 working group is pleased to announce the third release, Alpha 3. Refer release definitions [here](https://github.com/notaryproject/notation/blob/main/RELEASE_MANAGEMENT.md). This release includes updates to the [notaryproject/notaryproject](https://github.com/notaryproject/notaryproject) repo to provide the community with updated specifications and an updated implementation of Notation client for signing and verifying artifacts.

- [Notary v2 specifications](https://github.com/notaryproject/notaryproject) ***[(notaryproject-v1.0.0-draft.3)](https://github.com/notaryproject/notaryproject/releases/tag/v1.0.0-draft2)***    (Updated in this release)  
- [Notation Library 1](https://github.com/notaryproject/notation-core-go) ***[(notation-go-v1.0.0-alpha.3)](https://github.com/notaryproject/notation-core-go/releases/tag/v0.1.0-alpha.3)***   (Added in this release)
- [Notation Library 2](https://github.com/notaryproject/notation-go) ***[(notation-go-v0.10.0-alpha.3)](https://github.com/notaryproject/notation-go/releases/tag/v0.10.0-alpha.3)***   (Updated in this release)
- [Notation CLI](https://github.com/notaryproject/notation)   ***([notation-v0.10.0-alpha.3)](https://github.com/notaryproject/notation/releases/tag/v0.10.0-alpha.3)***   (Updated in this release) 
## Goal of the release
- Update Notary v2 specifications 
    - Community can use the updated specifications to develop their own implementation of Notary v2 in language/platforms of their choice, and/or contribute to Notation client development.
    - Signature format (JWS) for signing and verification in RC-1.
    - Updates on use of plugins for signing and verification. Plugins let vendors and users integrate base Notation client with their choice of Key Vaults and PKI.
 - Update "Notation" (CLI client) implementation to match the latest specifications. With the new client, users can
    - Sign images with remote key stores that securely store the signing keys
    - Verify signatures using Trust stores configured in Notation clients
    - Sign images and Verify signatures with locally stored test keys/certificates for demonstration use only
    - Setup Trust stores with the new directory-based structure
    - Configure Trust Policy as a JSON document. Support for registry scope and signature verfication levels to customize the behaviour during verification.
    - Store signatures in registries compliant to the ORAS Reference spec [RC-1](https://github.com/oras-project/oras-go/releases/tag/v2.0.0-rc.2)

*We do not recommend this release for use in production environment. Refer release definitions [here](https://github.com/notaryproject/notation/blob/main/RELEASE_MANAGEMENT.md). We suggest using it for testing and providing feedback to the Notary v2 working group only*

## List of feature/capabilities added with this release
For detailed notes on each of the individual repositories (NotaryProject, Notation (for reference CLI implementation) and Notation libraries) users can refer to the individual release notes. A summary view is provided in this document.

### Notary v2 specifications
Updated Trust Policy, Trust Store,  Signature Verification and Signing workflows along with extensibility mechanisms via Notation plugins.
- A final JWS based [signature envelope format.](https://github.com/notaryproject/notaryproject/blob/main/signature-envelope-jws.md)
- Updated [Signature specfication](https://github.com/notaryproject/notaryproject/blob/main/signature-envelope-jws.md) with extensibility provisions for additional signature envelope format.
- Updated [signing and verification workflows](https://github.com/notaryproject/notaryproject/blob/main/signing-and-verification-workflow.md)
- Introducing a new [Signing scheme](https://github.com/notaryproject/notaryproject/blob/main/signing-scheme.md) to integrate Notation Client with Signing Services
- Updated  [trust store and trust policy](https://github.com/notaryproject/notaryproject/blob/main/trust-store-trust-policy-specification.md) specification

### Notation CLI Client
Notation is a standalone CLI client based on Notary v2 specs. It supports signing, verifying, and storing signatures in [oras-artifacts-spec](https://github.com/oras-project/artifacts-spec/) compliant registries. Starting with this release of Notation, the trust store will be based on a directory structure and trust policy as a JSON document. Users can simply insert  the public certificates inside pre-configured directories for configuring their trust store, and modify the trust policy document to granularly control the scope and behavior of the signature verification policies. The use of the existing CLI commands (introduced in the alpha-1 version of Notation client when the keys/certificates for signing and verifying were specified in a file) has been subsituted by use of a directory based trust store.  Refer https://github.com/notaryproject/notation/blob/main/specs/notation-config.md.

In this release of Notation command, the following CLI commands are supported. Refer (TBD - Getting started here)
- notation sign  
- notation verify
- notation plugin list
- notation cert generate-test

To start using Notation Refer: https://github.com/notaryproject/notation/blob/main/hello-signing.md

### Notation Library 
Written in the GO language the Library is divided up into two separate repos - [Notation-go](https://github.com/notaryproject/notation-go) and [Notation-core-go](https://github.com/notaryproject/notation-core-go)

## List of fixed issues
Refer individual release notes.

## Roadmap Guidance
*This is not an exhaustive list. Users should refer to the Notary v2 roadmap at https://github.com/notaryproject/roadmap#readme for seeing the plan for subsequent releases and refer to individual subprojects (repositories) releases notes for details*

1. The current signature format JWS is the proposed format for RC-1 release. Notary v2 community plans to support additional signature formats ( such as COSE)
2. Revocation support via Notation client will come in a future release
3. Alternate signature storage schemes which can use OCI Distribution 1.0 based registries is under investigation for a future release

### Backwards Compatibility
This version of Notation client is not compatible with any of the prior releases.
